# Instructions

This element of the code is to be implemented into the Hydra visual synthesizer which can be found here:

The visual synth itself is written in Javascript, and can be extended through Javascript functions. The code written in the text file in this repository is meant to be copied and pasted directly into the version of the synth hosted at the above address.

However, the synth can also be self hosted and extended utilizing its associated NPM package which can be found here:

Thank you Olivia Jack for such an amazing tool!
